<!-- Next steps, 10/24 -> the next step I will practice is to separate the navigation section into a separate html file called nav.html. It will be linked to the css which I can clean up and modularize. Ill then be loading it using JavaScript for a freindly front-end approach that should be acceptable for smaller websites such as this one. However, if I wish to use a server-side method to load the navigation elements to all of my webpages, I can do that at a later time so long as I learn the technologies necessary. Ill add these notes here to a readme that ill begin after adding this nav section -->
